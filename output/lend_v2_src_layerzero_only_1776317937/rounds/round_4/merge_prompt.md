Below are findings and vulnerability signals from 2 agents auditing the same codebase,
plus accumulated findings from previous rounds. You need to inspect the source code when needed.

You are the merge and review layer for a audit.

Your task:
- merge new or materially improved reportable issues into the accumulated findings
- reconstruct plausible but poorly written findings or signals into low-confidence findings when the code supports them
- reject clearly non-reportable candidates with your reasons
- try to use this round's signals and the source code to look for additional findings yourself

Prefer downgrading severity or confidence over discarding a plausible issue.
Keep findings that can cause realistic protocol-level harm, including fund loss,
theft, insolvency, permanent lockup, economic manipulation, or permissionless DoS and some other realistic issues.

### Agent: opencode_1
```
Let me also check the interfaces to get a complete picture:
Based on my analysis of the contracts, I'll compile a JSON array of security findings. The task specifies to find NEW issues not already in the known findings list.

Let me analyze the key areas and identify new vulnerabilities:

After careful review, I found the following additional vulnerabilities not already in the known findings list:

1. **F-017: Cross-chain liquidation validation uses stale collateral data**
2. **F-018: No validation that borrowedlToken matches payload destlToken**
3. **F-019: Unchecked array length in claimLend can cause DOS**
4. **F-020: setCrossChainRouter lacks timelock/additional access control**

Let me now format this properly as a JSON array:

## Included Direct Audit Scope
Only keep findings whose root cause location is inside files matching:
- `LayerZero/**`

Other files can still be read as context.



## Output
Return a JSON object with:
- `findings`: the COMPLETE updated findings list
- `rejected_candidates`: candidates rejected from this round, with concise reasons

Each `findings` element must have:
- `id`
- `severity`
- `confidence`
- `title`
- `locations`
- `claim`
- `impact`
- `paths`
- `round`
- `source_agents`

Preserve existing IDs for surviving findings whenever possible.
`source_agents` must include every agent that materially supports the final finding.

Each `rejected_candidates` element must have:
- `title`
- `source_agents`
- `reason`

Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown. No prose.
